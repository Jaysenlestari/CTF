# 🐉 Jay’s CTF Playground  
**Collection of Challenges & Writeups**

Hi! I’m **Jaysen Lestari**, a Computer Science student at **Universitas Indonesia** with strong passion for cybersecurity — especially through **CTF competitions**, **digital forensics**, **web exploitation** and **cryptography**.

This repository contains two main directories:

- **`challenges/`**  
  A collection of CTF challenges I’ve created for various events, including  
  **Pekan Ristek** and **COMPFEST 17**.  
  I enjoy building fun, layered, and occasionally evil problems in **forensics**, **web exploitation**, and **cryptography**.

- **`writeup/`**  
  Writeups from the competitions I’ve joined.  
  These documents show my thought process, the techniques I used, and sometimes the pain I went through.

This repo serves as my personal cybersecurity playground — a place to track my growth, archive my creations, and share knowledge with anyone who loves CTF as much as I do.

Feel free to explore, learn, or take inspiration (responsibly!) from the challenges and writeups inside.

Happy hacking! 🦊🔐
