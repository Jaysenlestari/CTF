description: A researcher in Mondstadt’s tech division received an urgent-looking HTML file, claiming to be a critical security patch. Trusting its source, they executed antivirus.exe and moments later, a secret PDF file disappeared.
The PDF contained a confidential override PIN tied to the Vision Distribution Network. To protect it, the researcher locked the PDF with their wallet’s seed phrase (exported from a Chrome extension), joined with an underscore (_) as the password.
Although the wallet vault file remains on disk, the password to unlock it has since been lost. Fortunately, there’s a lead: the researcher once copied the vault password to clipboard."
